# ✈️ Flight Ticket Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the price of flight tickets using machine learning techniques.  
We used a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction) containing real flight data, including details like airline, departure time, class, and number of days left until departure.

## 📌 Project Goal

Build a machine learning model to predict the ticket price based on:

- Airline
- Departure and arrival time
- Class (Economy / Business)
- Days left until departure



## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python 3
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Results

### 🔹 Linear Regression
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 49,811,326  
- **R² Score:** 0.90

### 🔹 Random Forest Regressor
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 2,725.84  
- **R² Score:** 0.99

✅ **Random Forest** performed significantly better in terms of accuracy and generalization.
